# Machine Learning Model Project

## Overview
This project involves a complex machine learning model integrating an RBM Layer, a Q-Learning Layer, and Transformer Encoder. It is designed for experimenting with reinforcement learning techniques and neural network architectures.

## Contents
- `model.py`: The main script containing the model's architecture and training logic. It includes the RBM Layer, ReplayBuffer, QLearningLayer, and other necessary components for model building.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python packages required to run the project.
- `README.md`: This file, providing a comprehensive guide to the project.
- `main.yml`: Configuration for the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

## Setup and Installation
To set up the project:
1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Install dependencies: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your project directory.
4. Run the script: Execute `python model.py` to start the model training or testing.

## Usage
- The `model.py` script can be run directly after setting up the environment. It will initiate the model building process and output the results.
- To modify the model, edit the `model.py` script, adjusting layers, parameters, or the training process as needed.
