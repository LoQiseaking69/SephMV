# Seph's MVP
## This repository is the intermediate step; where the model code is finalized and prepared, for integration with the GA component.

for building and testing, here is the provided test notebook: [SM2](https://github.com/LoQiseaking69/SM2)

# **"Moving Forward"** <-->
updates to [SM3](https://github.com/LoQiseaking69/SM3) can be "reverse implemented" or cross-referenced with sm2; although, SM3 attempts to further optimize and compartmentalize compilation and training across multiple cloud performance instances...

## Overview
This project involves a complex machine learning model integrating an RBM Layer, a Q-Learning Layer, and Transformer Encoder. It is designed for experimenting with reinforcement learning techniques and neural network architectures. Additionally, it includes a model evaluation script (`model_eval.py`) for assessing the performance of the trained model.

## Contents
- `model.py`: The main script containing the model's architecture and training logic. It includes the RBM Layer, ReplayBuffer, QLearningLayer, and other necessary components for model building.
- `model_eval.py`: Script for evaluating the trained model on the environment over a specified number of episodes.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python packages required to run the project.
- `README.md`: This file, providing a comprehensive guide to the project.
- `main.yml`: Configuration for the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

## Setup and Installation
To set up the project:
1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Install dependencies: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your project directory.
4. Run the script: Execute `python model.py` to start the model training or testing.

## Usage
- The `model.py` script can be run directly after setting up the environment. It will initiate the model building process and output the results.
- The `model_eval.py` script evaluates the trained model's performance on the environment over a specified number of episodes. To use it, execute `python model_eval.py` after training the model.
- To modify the model, edit the `model.py` script, adjusting layers, parameters, or the training process as needed.
